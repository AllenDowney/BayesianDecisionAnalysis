    "The algorithm I presented in this notebook is called [Thompson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling).  It is an example of a general strategy called [Bayesian decision theory](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Bayesian_decision_theory), which is the idea of using a posterior distribution as part of a decision-making process, usually by choosing an action that minimizes the costs we expect on average (or maximizes a benefit).\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, this strategy is the biggest advantage of Bayesian methods over classical statistics.  When we represent knowledge in the form of probability distributions, Bayes's theorem tells us how to change our beliefs as we get more data, and Bayesian decision theory tells us how to make that knowledge actionable."
