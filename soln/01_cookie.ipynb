    "\n",
    "* It is a divide-and conquer strategy for computing conditional probabilities.  If it's hard to compute $P(A|B)$ directly, sometimes it is easier to compute the terms on the other side of the equation: $P(A)$, $P(B|A)$, and $P(B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is also a recipe for updating beliefs in the light of new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are working with the second interpretation, we often write Bayes's Theorem with different variables.  Instead of $A$ and $B$, we use $H$ and $D$, where\n",

    "* $H$ stands for \"hypothesis\", and\n",
    "\n",
    "* $D$ stands for \"data\".\n",
